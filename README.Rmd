The `mointoRingrepoRt` package is a collection of functions that will aid in the production of the Annual [Mission Fulfillment Monitoring Report](https://www.bigbend.edu/monitoring-reports/) that is produced by the Big Bend [Institutional Research and Planning Department](https://www.bigbend.edu/information-center/institutional-research-planning/).

To install the `mointoRingrepoRt` package run the following code:

```{r installation}
devtools::install_github("Edgar-Zamora/mointoRingrepoRt")
```

# BBCC Branding

To provide uniform branding throughout the Mission Fulfillment Report, there are two functions that can be used. 

## `bbcc_theme()`

By using the `bbcc_theme()` function while building a graphic will modify non-data components of the data plot. It is recommended that this function be used every time a graphic is created as to have consistency between graphs. All of the modifiable parts of a graphic, the `bbcc_theme()` only focusess ona few including text, grid, legend, and strip elements.

Below is a plot that uses is the default theme.

```{r bbcc_theme_1}
plot <- mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(mpg, cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Mpg v. Cyl"
  )

```

As you can see above the theme may not be exactly what we would be looking for. Instead of changing ever plot we have indidivudally we can just call the `bbcc_theme()` function. 

```{r bbcc_theme_2}
plot +
  theme_bbcc() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 25)
  )

```

As you can see, using the `theme_bbcc()` function changes the plot without needing to individually specify each element. This will avoid the potential to forget something if all the plots that are bound to be included. Using the bbcc theme also does not repress the ability to use the regular theme component for those elements that are particular to a plot. 

## `bbcc_cols()`
